    <div class="item_content">
        <p>As you can see in our web, we have three different listings:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Attendees</strong>: people with a public profile that will be attending the conference. This listing includes the speakers, the sponsors and every registered user who paid for a seat.</li>
<li>
<strong>Speakers</strong>: people delivering a talk</li>
<li>
<strong>All</strong>: everybody with a public profile who registered in the site (either attending or not). Registered users can comment or vote the talks, since we will have live-streaming, even if they didn't get in time for getting a seat in the conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot see your profile in any of the listings, chances are you didn't mark your profile as public. If you paid for your ticket and you have a public profile and you still don't appear listed as attendee please contact us to double check the payment information.</p>

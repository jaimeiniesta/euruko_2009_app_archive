        <p>We would like to give a <big>big thank you</big> to everybody attending <strong>EuRuKo 2009</strong> for their enthusiasm, to the speakers for the great work they did and to our sponsors for making all of this possible.</p>

<p>If you were taking pictures and you would like to share them, don't forget to <strong>tag them</strong> in flickr like this http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/euruko2009/</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to be hosting the conference this year, and we would like to congratulate the fantastic representation of <strong>Polish rubyists</strong> on the opportunity to hold the event next time (gratulacje!). After meeting them in Barcelona, we are sure EuRuKo 2010 is going to be a big success. </p>

<p>See you all in Kraków!</p>

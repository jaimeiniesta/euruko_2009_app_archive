    <div class="item_content">
        <p>Apart from being our silver sponsor, <a href="http://www.xing.com">XING</a> has kindly arranged an informal cocktail supper on Saturday, right after the lighting talks. The buffet will be conveniently served at the building of the venue, with an open terrace available for those who want to enjoy Barcelona's fine weather.</p>

<p>The supper will be a light buffet featuring <a href="http://www.gencat.cat/catalunya/eng/cuina.htm">typical Catalonian products</a> -which by the way are superb- such as the traditional "pa amb tomàquet", ham, cheese, assorted sausages, olives... all of those served with your choice of soft drinks, beer, wine and coffee.</p>

<p>It will be the perfect <b>framework</b> for making <b>small talk</b> and a nice <b>closure</b> for the day.</p>

<p>The organization board would like to thank XING for making this possible. Kudos guys!</p>

        <h1>Citilab</h1>

<p>As you already know the venue for EuRuKo 2009 is <a href="http://en.citilab.eu/home/" title="Citilab">Citilab</a>, a center for promoting new technologies located in a wonderful building.</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472562761/" title="euruko_venue_21 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3472562761_0c1266b468.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_21"></a>
</p>

<p><a href="http://en.citilab.eu/home/" title="Citilab">Citilab</a> will provide EuRuKo 2009 with a modern room for 250 people:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/2515429227/" title="Main conference room at Citilab by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3135/2515429227_d3738d97ff.jpg" width="500" height="214" alt="Main conference room at Citilab"></a>
</p>

<p>Their own staff will also take care of all technical details, projector, sound, wifi, recording, live streaming. We'll have about 60 sockets. They've hosted a lot of important events, like <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EU_MozCamp_2008" title="Mozilla Camp Europe 2008">Mozilla Camp Europe 2008</a> or the <a href="http://en.citilab.eu/information/news/first-lego-league-rocks-cornella" title="Lego League">FIRST Lego League</a>. It's going to be a superb venue.</p>

<h1>How to Get There</h1>

<h2>Address</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.citilab.eu/home/" title="Citilab">Citilab</a> is located in Cornellà de Llobregat, a city very close to Barcelona. The address of the venue is:</p>

<p align="center">
Pl. Can Suris, s/n<br>
08940 Cornellà de Llobregat (Barcelona)<br>
Phone: 93 551 06 60
</p>

<p>A taxi from the center of Barcelona may cost around 25/30 euros.</p>

<h2>Going by Metro</h2>

<p>It is very easy to get to <a href="http://en.citilab.eu/home/" title="Citilab">Citilab</a> from Barcelona by metro. Barcelona has several lines, their code include a number and a color:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472514347/" title="euruko_venue_5 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3621/3472514347_c016a8fd35.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_5"></a>
</p>

<p>You have to somehow get the blue line (Line 5, L5) heading towards "Cornellà":</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472508729/" title="euruko_venue_1 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3303/3472508729_655ff1da22.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_1"></a>
</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3473318988/" title="euruko_venue_2 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3473318988_4ef75a90c4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_2"></a>
</p>

<p>Destination is the last station, which is actually called "Cornellà Centre". That's the leftmost one in this picture:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472513589/" title="euruko_venue_4 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3408/3472513589_e74567e581.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_4"></a>
</p>

<p>If you need an estimation, each station takes about 1.5 minutes.</p>

<p>Once you arrive to the destination:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472515325/" title="euruko_venue_6 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3615/3472515325_fe1f039f5c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_6"></a>
</p>

<p>follow the sign that reads "Sortida":</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3473325478/" title="euruko_venue_7 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3318/3473325478_de9b713c68.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_7"></a>
</p>

<p>Catalonia has two official languages: Spanish and Catalan. Both of them have strong usage but you'll normally find only Catalan in signs. "Sortida" is Catalan for "Exit".</p>

<p>Go upstairs here:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472517071/" title="euruko_venue_8 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/3472517071_57b6532786.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_8"></a>
</p>

<p>and at the top take this passage slightly to your right:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472517915/" title="euruko_venue_9 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3630/3472517915_8e773d6398.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_9"></a>
</p>

<p>Going straight ahead you'll identify this place:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472518821/" title="euruko_venue_10 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/3472518821_a57b58b3de.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_10"></a>
</p>

<p>That's a tunnel for a tram, but it goes out in just a few meters. Cross the street to get to the opposite sidewalk, and turn to the left, in the same sidewalk and direction of the person in the picture above. You'll see this:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472520979/" title="euruko_venue_13 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3659/3472520979_1da21e1ebc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_13"></a>
</p>

<p>Now you have two options: Wait for a tram, or have a 8 minutes walk. We'll explain going by foot in this section, and taking the tram in the next section.</p>

<p>Getting to the venue by foot at this point is very easy.</p>

<p>First follow the sidewalk until you get out:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472599269/" title="euruko_venue_30 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3598/3472599269_65c70660a0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_30"></a>
</p>

<p>Then just follow the rails of the tram, they'll guide you to the door of the venue. The tram basically goes down a bit:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3473407132/" title="euruko_venue_28 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3410/3473407132_2eaa583013.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_28"></a>
</p>

<p>then performs a right angle towards the right surrounding this mall:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472525139/" title="euruko_venue_18 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3556/3472525139_8a6196ac89.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_18"></a>
</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3473344676/" title="euruko_venue_19 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3401/3473344676_2aacc51f9e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_19"></a>
</p>

<p>and then goes on in a straight line:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3473404876/" title="euruko_venue_26 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3658/3473404876_1d5ba2452a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_26"></a>
</p>

<p>In a moment you'll see the venue to your left:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472562761/" title="euruko_venue_21 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3472562761_0c1266b468.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_21"></a>
</p>

<h2>Going by Tram</h2>

<p>In this side of Barcelona, the left side, there are three tram lines, T1, T2, and T3.</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3472522427/" title="euruko_venue_14 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3330/3472522427_be7d2e0038.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_14"></a>
</p>

<p>Their end in Barcelona city is located at Plaça Francesc Macià. Both lines T1 and T2 have a station exactly in front of <a href="http://en.citilab.eu/home/" title="Citilab">Citilab</a>, which is called "Fontsanta I Fatjó". Do NOT take line T3.</p>

<p>If you went by metro following the instructions above, when you cross the rails of the tram in the tunnel and start walking towards the left, there's a tram station right there:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3473329872/" title="euruko_venue_12 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3417/3473329872_89567391ca.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_12"></a>
</p>

<p>During weekends there's a tram each 10 minutes more or less. You can take the first one because that station belongs only to lines T1 and T2:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3473333858/" title="euruko_venue_17 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3369/3473333858_551fd329a2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_17"></a>
</p>

<p>The ticket of the metro allows you to take the tram at no additional cost (as long as you take it in the following hour after you left the metro or some rule like that). You need to pass the ticket of the metro to validate it. The second station is "Fontsanta I Fatjó", the one of the venue, you'll recognize the building clearly to your left:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25468319@N02/3473345460/" title="euruko_venue_20 by fxnoria, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3322/3473345460_d302a5ed1a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="euruko_venue_20"></a>
</p>

<p>To go back you can take a tram in the opposite direction and then the metro. The same process backwards. But in that case the ticket of the tram does not allow you to take the metro for free.</p>

<p>A T-10 ticket for metro gives you 10 tickets that allow free changes metro -&gt; tram, tram -&gt; metro. You can purchase a T-10 at any metro station, with money or credit card. (Careful, the T-10 sold in tram stations is a different T-10.)</p>

I’ve been working with computers for 25 years, doing with them almost anything that can be done with a computer. I like robots and shakuhachi.</p>

<p>I’m currently doing a lot of web development, and I’m happily working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I’m the cofounder and lead developer of sidirect, a international platform for the real estate market.</p>

<p>When I got some free time, I like to hack new features in echowaves, our amazing “group chat social network”.</p>

<p>I’m married with a beautiful woman and we have a son called AKIRA.</p>

My first experiences with games development came mainly from the hacking involved in the POKE[2] statements necessary to cheat and get unlimited lives.</p>

<p>Since 1995 I've been earning my salt in software development, doing this and that in different places, industries and companies, including a small java-centric shop I co-founded -and then cowardly left- some years ago. Along these years I've delivered training on things like Robotics, Software Engineering, JAVA. PHP and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Apart from the occasional freelancing or training gig, I've spent roughly the last 3 years working for ASPgems[3] doing Ruby (on Rails) development. </p>

<p>I'm also the author of the book "Aptana RadRails: An IDE for Rails Development"[4] and an active member of the local Ruby scene, being a founding member of the Spanish Rails Conference[5] , the Spanish Ruby Users Group[6] and madrid-rb[7], the Ruby users group in Madrid. </p>
